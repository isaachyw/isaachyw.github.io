Greetings, I am a dedicated undergraduate pursuing dual degrees in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering from the esteemed institutions of
the University of Michigan and Shanghai JiaoTong University.
My expertise primarily revolves around the domains of computer architecture , system and quantum computing. In particular, I have work with Prof. Gokul Ravi on quantum computing fidelity estimation and resource allocation (In submitted to ASPLOS 2024). And I have worked with Prof. Baris Kasikci on datacenter processor and micro-op cache design. I have also worked with Prof Brendan Kochunas and Kyle Valgun on Unstructured Meshed Code Library.
Apart from my academic pursuits, I also find solace in indulging in various physical activities like basketball, powerlifting, and hiking.
